We were able to cut state taxes by $4 billion, last session, we passed a property tax reform package that would have given voters the power to veto large property tax increases by election.

We must keep pushing to provide our kids an outstanding education and to give our homeowners relief from skyrocketing property taxes. We can do both and I am running again to get it done.

During my 26-year tenure in the legislature, I have passed legislation in each of these areas that have helped transform Texas for the better. \n\nCriminal Justice: I passed the Sandra Bland Act to start solving the issues related to criminal justice reform. The Act includes de-escalation training for officers, improving the process to make complaint/complement of officers, jail diversion, jail safety, improved data collection, and improvements to mental healthcare.\n\nHealthcare: I passed legislation creating the health disparities task force to review treatment and outcome disparities based on different groupings including race/ethnicity, and geographical region. I joint-authored Rep. Thierry’s bill she introduced during the regular session to improve the maternal mortality board by looking into how race/ethnicity impacts outcomes. I joint-authored legislation to create Texas’ CHIP program and fought to increase the number of children who could sign up during the Speaker Craddick years in the House. I passed the original mental health parity law, and worked last session to expand the definition of what is included with my colleagues on the Public Health Committee. I also passed legislation to provide teachers with mental health first aid training and increase funding for mental healthcare. I have also worked with the federal government to get and extend the 1115 transformation waiver which helps provide Texas with billions of dollars to provide healthcare to people who are uninsured or underserved. I was asked to and did serve as a member of President Obama’s White House Working Group of State Legislators for Health Care Reform that helped develop and pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n \nEducation: Education has been and always will be the great equalizer for people of color, people with limited income, and women. That is why I have filed a bill the last few sessions to have quality full-day Pre-K in every school district and elementary school. We need to increase state funding for public education and prevent funding from being siphoned off to unaccountable voucher programs. The goal for every child should be to attend and finish a four-year college or complete skills training. To make that a reality, we must make a quality education affordable. That is why I voted against tuition deregulation in 2003 and have supported legislation to reinstate tuition regulation.  I also helped pass and have worked to protect the top 10% rule in Texas.\n\nAffordable Housing: There is not enough affordable housing in District 147, Houston, and in communities of color in Texas in general.

Winning state-wide office as a Democrat will completely shatter the good-old-boy tradition of corrupt, unresponsive, embarrassing politics in Texas.  Every politician in the state will immediately realize they have to serve everyone, not just the very small group of Republican primary voters who effectively control our politics. Besides, Texans want their Lt Governor to role up his or her sleeves, solve the many problems we face as a state with skill, and do his or her work with absolute integrity and a sense of fairness. Honest, fair, responsible government is what we all want, and we're not getting anything like it thanks to one-party rule and the political inbreeding that results.",

The leaders of old weren't perfect, and we can certainly improve on their record of compassion and respect. But we can't improve anything as long as our top leaders are obsessed with their own power and prestige. We can have a great business climate, and be a great state at the same time. We can live in a state that produces good paying jobs, and also is welcoming and compassionate. Once Texans get a taste of honest, fair-minded, solution-oriented leadership, they'll never go back to the hyper-partisan, zero-progress politics of the moment.",

Recent state fiscal policy is to blame, and we must reverse these policies. Falsely blaming local governments -- the only play Republicans know how to run -- has NOT resulted in lower property taxes. Nor will it ever. Just look at the impact that 25 years of Republican dominance has had on your tax bill.",
    "secondPriority": "Increase investment in infrastructure, particularly transportation, water, and my personal passion, public education (not vouchers). We can do this AND lower property taxes, but only if we reverse recent state fiscal policies and form a partnership, as we once did, with big corporations to fund these investments.",
    "thirdPriority": "Make transparency and accountability REAL, not just a campaign slogan. We know from the corporate world how to do this. I will (a) propose legislation that combines existing state functions into the Texas Audit, Performance, and Integrity Commission (\"APIC\") that will be structured in a never-done-before manner that strips political influence completely away; and (b) I will propose a constitutional amendment to create a Redistricting Commission, similarly protected from even a hint of political influence, and in so doing end gerrymandering, democracy's truest nemesis, in Texas forever.",
    "differences": "My opponent is a good family man and I like him.  But I believe I am uniquely qualified to lead Texas out of the fiscal mess we're in. With property taxes exploding, and debt beginning to overwhelm us, and precious little money to invest in infrastructure and public education, we are headed to a really bad place financially. We not only have to solve these problems, but we need to keep the job-creation machine humming. The incumbent has shown us that without these skills our financial woes only worsen. Government in general, and Texas government in particular, needs deep financial, management, and job-creation skills and experience.  That's what I believe I have to offer.",

I have put that knowledge to work at the agency throughout my first five years as your Railroad Commissioner. \n\nWhen I was thinking about running for Railroad Commissioner in 2011, one of the main reasons I ultimately decided to run was that I wanted to be a part of the team that would help bring the agency into the 21st century. Like any aging regulatory agency, the Commission’s need for technology and process upgrades had become critical so as not to hinder the growth of Texas energy production. \n\nStarting on day one at the Commission, I made this a top priority.\nThroughout my term, that has meant bringing more of our data online, addressing dire needs related to information technology infrastructure and finding efficiencies in our rules and processes. These accomplishments have allowed us to do our job better, saving time and money for the state and those doing business at the agency. \n\nIn 2011, the state restructured how it funds the Railroad Commission and cuts to the agency’s budget left important areas underfunded and unable to fully carry out their mission. I campaigned on, and succeeded in securing funding to address these issues and support a major IT overhaul at the agency. We have used those funds to increase transparency by making agency data more accessible to the public and accelerate inspections and permitting times.\n\nIn our recent modernization of the agency, I have continued to stand for common sense regulatory oversight of a robust energy sector while carefully balancing our state’s economic and environmental concerns. Today, with science-based, pro-growth regulation, we have proven we can have cleaner air and water, as well as economic growth and expanded energy development in Texas. \n\nThis past year, during the 85th Regular Session, I was proud to successfully lead the effort to re-authorize the Railroad Commission through the Sunset review process, which is essentially a legislative audit of the agency. We are implementing the legislature’s recommended changes and are thankful to continue the important work we do for Texas for another 12 years. \n\nIn addition to these critical accomplishments, I have continued to push back on Washington overreach, protecting states’ rights in the management of safe energy production within their own borders. \n\nWhen it comes to transport facilities such as pipelines and ports, I have advocated for timely federal permitting and necessary funding for the development of our state’s important infrastructure. Our state’s energy industry cannot continue to grow without it. \n\nTo conserve freshwater, I have stood for appropriate regulation that allows the industry to maximize recycling in oil and gas operations and expanded use of reclaimed water throughout the energy production process.\n\nI have been a champion for creating new opportunities for Texas energy companies through the privatization of the Mexican energy sector while assisting Mexican officials with information on Texas’ leading energy regulatory policies. If our southern neighbor is successful in energy regulation and production, Texans will also benefit from that success.",

    "reason": "One evening in January of 2017, I was thinking about the questions my five-year old son may one day ask me when he reads history books about the political moment we are all living through. I was alarmed at the prospect.\n\nAt the time, President Trump was in the throes of institutionalizing his anti-immigrant rhetoric with an unconstitutional executive order that barred immigration from foreign countries, apparently as a result of their religious affiliation. President Trump disobeyed direct court rulings against the executive order, all the while lambasting our judiciary. I realized many so-called Republicans were complicit in this effort. With traditional Republican values at stake, I urged Senator Cruz - a candidate I had supported for Senate in 2012 - to continue his principled opposition to executive overreach and to oppose the President's decision.\n\nWhen Cruz' office made it clear they would remain silent, I realized our country and the integrity of my party stood at the gates of a crisis. Why did they toe the party line while the integrity of our national character hung in the balance?\n\nOne day, I knew I would have to tell my sons about the time America fearfully barred its doors to the world. I'd have to explain how tweets – tweets! – systematically dismantled the proud legitimacy of our independent judiciary. He would want to know – indeed, he would deserve to know – what I and others of my generation did when the political elite saddled him with a crushing national debt.\n\nI'm running because I want to be able to look the next generation in the eye when I tell them, \"We did everything we could to bring our precious republic back from the brink.",
    "transformTexas": "For over a decade, our legislators have been incapable of ensuring a functioning government in Washington. They have proven utterly inept at negotiating enduring solutions, productive outcomes or even finding common ground with their fellow lawmakers.  They have been focused instead solely on raising funds for re-election and their PACs.  At the time we need them most, our lawmakers have abdicated their responsibility to act as a co-equal branch of government and a check on this Executive’s deliberate amateurism.  Republican career politicians like the Senator from Texas have either failed in their Constitutional duties despite their best efforts, or they are unwilling to carry out their constitutional responsibilities out of political convenience. \n\nAs a representative in the Federal Government, I will return to a more classic, pragmatic style of government.  I will bring home the bacon and this will benefit every single Texan as well as the businesses that call Texas home.  I will bring federal infrastructure money to dredge ports, build pipelines, highways, and water infrastructure.  I will bring federal money to provide Texans with free vocational training.  I will end the focus on out-of-state energy interests like coal and ethanol and focus on cleaner Texas wind, gas and oil.  I will work hard to bring universal access to physical and mental healthcare to all, not play political games with Veteran's access to medicaid and marijuana. I will restructure our immigration system.",
    "firstPriority": "TRADE\nThe populist calls to redefine our trade relationship with Mexico under NAFTA overlooks the role international trade plays in the Texas economy.\n\nOur state benefits from $38 Billion in trade each year under NAFTA, and from the immense investment along our border communities in places like El Paso, McAllen, Laredo, and Brownsville. Texas' economy also is buoyed by the millions of dollars recirculated in our state by international trade. NAFTA is paramount for the oil and gas industries, for the Port in Houston and Corpus. It is fundamental for Texas' agricultural industries as well: NAFTA allows our ranchers and farmers to access a larger market.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate I will fight to secure the support necessary to expand and modernize Texas' benefits through NAFTA. In light of the recent energy sector downturn, international trade will continue to be a major boon by diversifying the state's economy.",
    "secondPriority": "IMMIGRATION\nImmigration reform is an issue near and dear to many Texans, business owners, families, and law enforcement.\n\nHaving a functional legal immigration system is so vital to our state's economy that Texas should be leading the nation on this discussion. During my time in the Texas energy sector, I was often responsible for preparing 500 page applications for foreign skilled laborers to support our work in the state. It's no wonder that someone would choose to enter this country illegally. Throughout my campaign, I have offered solutions to reduce the number of illegal immigrants in our nation while improving security and collecting back taxes from undocumented individuals who benefited from our national services. \n\nWhat we need to truly reform the illegal immigration problem in our country is to make the legal process preferable to paying a cartel or coyote to cross into this nation. I believe we can be competitive with our visa and immigration application pricing to encourage the legal route and make the process simpler and more efficient. That would include instituting biometric entry/exit security systems to ensure we're welcoming productive immigrants without a criminal past. \n\nGiven the opportunity for millions of people to come out of the shadows, I believe undocumented immigrants would choose to pay back taxes on any received benefits (public education, law enforcement, etc), go through the immigration process retroactively with support from their American employers, and start openly contributing to the country that offers so much in return. \n\nI am not in favor of blanket amnesty granting full rights of citizenship to people who broke our law. That said, I believe we can act with compassion to fix the immigration system's failures to encourage people to follow the rule of law, keeping families together, and avoiding a major labor setback to Texas' agriculture, construction, and energy sectors.",
    "thirdPriority": "ENERGY\n\nI believe in ending the subsidies and regulations that favor Iowa corn and West Virginia's coal.  I'm in favor of employing a revenue-neutral and market-based solution to manage pollution levels, like the Carbon Fee and Dividend Model proposed by the Citizens' Climate Lobby and I note that as America's largest wind and natural gas producer, Texas interests are aligned with a long term move to a cleaner energy mix.  Texas, and Republicans must maintain a position of leadership on energy policy, and the energy industry deserves a senator who can be an effective ambassador.\n\nThe Republican Party is, as a whole, acquiescing credibility on climate change to Democrats. With many of Texas' energy sector players acknowledging climate change, I'm shocked we are still seeing doubt on the scientific facts coming from some of our political leaders.  I am also shocked that the Senator from Texas would support coal subsidies and policies that help ethanol - direct competitors to Texas interests.\n\nClimate change is happening. Mitigating its impacts must be a part of public policy discussions about the future of our economy and society. We have a moral obligation to do something about it that doesn't derail our nation's economy, businesses or family budgets, and I believe Republican values can help achieve that.",
    "differences": "I am running for US Senate because I no longer recognize the Republican Party I grew up with and believe it is important for the Senator from Texas to restore a focus on Texas interests in the national political debate.  I am an attorney with 10 years of experience in the energy industry successfully negotiating major domestic and international transactions and major projects onshore, offshore, in LNG, and representing or negotiating against governments.  I also gained a deep understanding of our financial system while representing major financial institutions during the financial crisis.  In short, my family and career have given me an insider's view of the major issues that affect Texas and America and I have the negotiating chops to reach pragmatic solutions that benefit real people, not just the donor class.\n\nWashington has been filled with ambitious, career government officials with years of building political donor networks. I find it odd and hypocritical that these people, constantly disparaging the government, are the same ones who have only every nurtured careers and ambitions in the government sector - never seeking out the experience of the rest of us in the private sector.  These people have focused on divisive partisan issues to raise their profile and vast sums of money at the expense of the real issues that plague Texans every day. Our infrastructure is crumbling, our immigration system is broken, our educational system is falling behind, especially in respect of the skilled trades required by the energy industry, rural healthcare is in crisis, maternal mortality is up, Opioids are a plague, and all the while career politicians laugh their way to the bank while our country burns.  \n\nI aim to buck the caricature of Republicans as the party of angry white men, mass shootings, and budget exploding tax cuts that is putting off a generation of young people.  I believe that for someone to do a good job, they have to believe their job is important and worthwhile.  I believe that representing Texas as Senator is a worthwhile job, a large and complex job that requires dedication and focus, rather than neglect - used only as a stepping stone for Presidential ambition.  I will be a strong and pragmatic voice for conservative causes that Democrats will work with, so that Texas interests in energy, trade and immigration can actually be dealt with and we can give our children a more prosperous country.\n\nAcross the state, voters have told me how refreshing it feels to get behind a candidate who is not in the pocket of the Mercer Family, who puts state and country ahead of party affiliation, and who puts the well-being of Texas ahead of his future career prospects. I hope you will agree.",

I played little league at Hidalgo Park and quarterbacked the Magnolia Park Sharks at Ingrando Park.  I ran around the neighborhood streets with my friends and had an inner-city Houston upbringing.  My father was a teacher at Edison, Cage, Tijerina, and Franklin elementary schools among others. As an assistant attorney general, my mother represented the State of Texas and managed a child support collection office in the greater East End.  My uncle still operates his law office on Telephone Rd. where he has served the community for 30+ years. My sister graduated from YES Prep Southeast.

I have argued in courts across Texas and cross-examined technical experts in various fields.  I will advocate on behalf of the people of The 29th as I have done for clients during my law practice.  My experience with the law will help me to better serve the people.  \n3) I am a Millenial. It is time for the next generation to help shape the future of our country. Also, it is important that our political leadership be able to relate to voters and be able to communicate about what is taking place in Washington.  Our campaign will do this best.

We must build a prosperity that includes everyone.  \n\nOur present system is not sustainable in several ways.  Climate change is real and must be addressed with incentives, research, and new business formation around renewable energy.  With intelligent leadership we will be more broadly prosperous with a transition away from carbon extraction than with the status quo.  Our absurd and artificial distribution of wealth is not sustainable.  History teaches that nations in our condition do not endure.",

Many of the skills and engineering expertise from the oil & gas industry can be redirected to lead the way into a world of sustainable fuels, which will be necessary to complement other renewable energy sources.  \n\n I will work for electoral reforms to more accurately express the will of the public.

Our tax system is riddled with favors for certain groups (particularly land speculators) and has been made much worse by the recent Republican tax bill.  The result is low-wages and ever escalating housing costs.  We need to redirect the tax code to neutralize monopoly power and privilege, particularly natural resource privileges.

I have worked in the federal government and in the U.S. Capitol.  I know what gets done and what does not.  I've successfully gotten federal agencies to change decades-old rules which were holding back research.  My bipartisan work, starting an initiative called Breaking Bread, has given me a unique perspective on how to connect with people whom I strongly disagree with, not by giving up on my principles, but demonstrating to them that I can fight for what is right for my country, while still listening to their concerns with civility and decency.  I strongly believe that at this point in our history, we need a clear, positive, optimistic movement to heal our country, and that is what I am offering.",

John Whitmire’s 44-year plus reign in the Texas legislature, longer than Saddam Hussein's reign over Iraq and Muammar Gaddafi's reign over Libya, also stifles progress and the passage of progressive policies by excluding an entire generation from serving in the Texas Senate and participating in shaping our future.  I grew up under different circumstances, in a different time and have a different perspectives and new ideas on how to solve the current day’s problems.  \n\nI am also running because the current officeholder, John Whitmire, is dangerous to the African American community in Texas and it is time for him to go.   As Chairman of the Criminal Justice Committee John Whitmire has: (i) caused more damage to the African American community by overseeing mass incarceration, and the racial disparity and disproportionate imprisonment of African Americans in the Texas criminal justice system, and (ii) obstructed and continues to obstruct the implementation of genuine criminal justice reform.

The state does not pay enough.

In the 1980s, the state funded 68% of school expenses, and now the state’s share is 38%.  Local property taxes have had to make up for this difference, and that is not the proper way to fund schools.",
    "thirdPriority": "My third priority is to address the infrastructure needs of the state, which includes highways and bridges, water supply, and coastal area flood control measures. Our highway infrastructure is insufficient for today’s population of 28 million and it will only get worse as we grow to more than 50 million people over the next 30 years. Although voters generously approved additional funding, the amount proposed by our Legislature was far short of the long-term need. Much of the state experiences frequent drought. We do not have enough reservoirs across Texas to adequately serve our growing population. Also, Hurricane Harvey shined a spotlight on a significant failure of our state government. Much of the flooding in the greater Houston area may have been avoided if Texas had built a third reservoir as it’s known it should have for more than a decade.",

I am humble enough to realize I don’t have all the answers, but we as a state do have all the answers if we’ll set our egos aside, invite the brightest minds to the table, and develop real solutions to the great challenges we face.\n\nI am dedicated to serving all people of Texas, and my number one goal will be to move forward legislation that protects our state’s interests.  I am a rational, traditional Republican offering an alternative to the incumbent’s irrational political priorities. We need someone who wants to get real work done in the Capitol.",

    "transformTexas": "By providing the service that our representatives were elected to perform.  I'm a small-town girl at heart and feel that spending almost $3 million on office space is a waste of money, I think that smaller offices in more cities and towns across Texas might provide better service to the constituency.  \n\nStrengthening the economy will be one of my priorities. I will fight every day for more good-paying jobs, to work with the business community to stem the tide of companies relocating outside the United States, to have more products stamped with the words “Made in America,” and help our Texas small business community expand and thrive. I am determined to make sure that all Texans have the ability and opportunity to reach their potential, and I will champion their cause across Texas and all around the country.\n\nI believe that accountability and transparency are essential to an open and honest government. I will never be afraid to hold open town hall meetings, to listen to what the people of Texas have to say and to fully understand what they need and want from their representative.  I will be their voice in Washington.\nI am committed to keeping Americans safe from threats overseas and at home.

I am concerned at the thought of our elections being infiltrated by a hostile foreign government and understands that our countries safety extends beyond the borders. When I am elected I will introduce legislation introducing a cyber-warfare branch of the military to be located right here in Texas.\n\nAs the mother to a young child, I understand the challenges that are facing families in today’s economy. I believe in the economic empowerment of women and working families, and believes that rules of the workplace need to be updated to keep up with our changing workforce. I believe that minimum wage should be raised, but it is a matter for each State to decide rather than a mandatory, across the board raise. \n\nI will fight for making quality child care more affordable, the need for universal Pre-K and equal pay for equal work. If elected I will help lead the fight in the Senate to protect working families, women, struggling children, seniors, and veterans. \n\nIn times of crisis I will come check out any devastation that happens in Texas -- and not just for a photo op.

A fiscal conservative stands for low taxes, reduced government spending, and minimal government debt.  Under the current administration, the Republicans in both the House and Senate have turned their back on the economies building that the GOP has stood proudly over generations. \n\nRepublicans do not increase the deficit based on what “may happen” with our economy.  Trickledown economics has never been a viable option and has ushered in a Depression and two Recessions.\n\nRepublicans prefer not to raise taxes and as such President Reagan’s tax cuts had to be reversed, as did the cuts under President George H Bush.  Drafting a bill that decreases the taxes on the wealthy while increasing the taxes of the middle class isn’t a Republican agenda.  \n\nI will transform Texas by flipping the script and listening to Texans instead of the movers and the shakers.  They are part of Texas, too.  But one person, one vote means something to me, so you'll get equal treatment. \n\nI was raised to work hard, tell the truth, compete fairly, and lead with honor to God and Country.

    "firstPriority": "Help the Middle Class \nThe key to economic growth is money in the pockets of the middle class. This is the exact opposite of what the 2017 Tax Bill does. Our economy is good, and the majority of economists have cautioned that this was not the time to pass such a drastic Tax Bill. It relies on the assumption that the 1% will invest the huge dividends they will be receiving from this Bill.  Trickle Down Economics have never worked in the history of the United States. In fact, they have caused a Depression and two Recessions all under Republican Presidents that went against GOP principles. \n\nI will bring legislation to the floor to repeal the provision that eliminated the inheritance tax for the 1%.\n\nRepublicans are deficit hawks; we do NOT increase the deficit at the request of our donors. No matter how this President, Senate and House try to sell it to the American public it is still giving money to the wealthy on the backs of the middle class. That is not who we are.\n\nThe world’s wealthiest country should not have such disparity between the wealthiest and the middle class and poor.  We need to help our citizens.  I believe in a lean government that works efficiently, relying on the states to make decisions, while the Federal Government maintains oversight.",

It started slowly as we all went about our daily lives, all the while, the special interest groups tinkered and changed things in the Republican party to move further and further toward “condemning” anyone who doesn’t agree with THEIR values or beliefs.  \n\nOur party moved away from some of our great fore Fathers such as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan, who all possessed strong Christian values, solid conservative fiscal policies, an intolerance for racial inequality and civil rights abuses. They both cared deeply about the Republican Party, and under their presidencies, we were the Grand Ole Party. What happened, how did we get here and what can we do to get back to our core principles? \n\nChristianity has been woven into the Republican platform since before the eighties.  However, as a Christian, we need to be reminded that many sects within Christianity and many different religions.  Our founding fathers set up a democracy that was in response to religious tyranny and we as a country are bound by that. \n\nThe Republican party is more diverse than the leadership, or the media would lead us to believe.  We run the gambit of the spectrum on social issues, much like many Texans do.  We need to stop the infighting and recognize that we are not nor, should we be the party of white, wealthy men. We are Republicans. We are fiscally conservative; we are diverse. We are not racists or bigots.  We are not intolerant. \n\nI am Country first! It’s time to end the fighting and get some bills passed.\nI pledge to each Texan that I will work with anyone who wants to solve a problem – Republican, Democrat, Independent, Green Party and Libertarians.

I will introduce legislation introducing a cyber-warfare branch of the military as suggested by Lieutenant Colonel Conti and Colonel Surdu:\n\nThe three major services are properly positioned to fight kinetic wars, and they value skills such as marksmanship, physical strength, the ability to leap out of airplanes and lead combat units under enemy fire. \n\nConti and Surdu reasoned, \"Adding an efficient and effective cyber branch alongside the Army, Navy and Air Force would provide our nation with the capability to defend our technological infrastructure and conduct offensive operations. Perhaps more important, the existence of this capability would serve as a strong deterrent for our nation's enemies.\" \n\nOur national security demands a state-of-the-art headquarters to combat this threat, staffed by our best.  We have a known this threat must be eliminated and our dated defenses won’t do the job.  Our national security is in jeopardy and we need a decisive plan and it doesn’t stop there.  Every department budget must include a security plan to combat cyber meddling.\n\nIf we extract ourselves from the Middle East, we risk Russia filling the void in the region.  Further, the United States would be at a disadvantage should we suffer another oil embargo.  It’s clear that to Russia, the Cold War never ended, and Putin’s intention is to rebuild the Soviet empire, one country at a time.",

Time to close these loopholes for the wealthy and special interests and take back our electoral system.\n\nRepresentatives should be loyal to their constituents.  I plan to submit bills for changes to our campaign finance rules, term limits, with a balanced budget legislation.\n\nTexas needs an honest, hardworking, and dedicated representative as our Senator.  Someone unimpressed with the national stage who wants to represent all Texans—not just special interests, party donors, and the one percent.\nMy constituents determine my vote, not Trump, not the Republican Party, nor anyone else.\n\nI’m hopeful that you will see my commitment and passion, not only in my website, but also on the campaign trail.  I’m not willing to throw in the towel with the Republican party without a fight.  However, being a Republican doesn’t mean you’ll get my vote like some rubber stamp.  Thank you for your consideration.",

Third, Bush’s\nGLO conduct starts as questionable- when he paid terminated employees,\nhundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars inappropriately as hush money so\nthat he could replace them with family friends and contributors.

    "reason": "Why are you running for office?\nI‘m HP Parvizian from Houston, Texas and I’m a Democratic candidate for the United States Congress,\nrunning to become the next U.S. Representative from Texas’ 2nd District.\nThe reason I am running for the United States Congress is because it is time to get everyone to unite and\nbring our community back together. While we may not always agree I believe we can find solutions so\nthat we can progress forward.\nI was raised in Houston, Texas from the age of two. My father Gus was a self-employed Oriental rugs\nbusinessman who was the true definition of the American Dream, and my mother Giti was a hair dresser,\na stay at home mom and the rock of our family. My parents instilled in me the values of respecting\neveryone, hard work, education, perseverance, and overall the importance of family.\nPerseverance is an interesting word and why does this word come into a sentence of values. Well, it has\nto with something my father went through while he was a taxi driver. My father was shot four times while\nbeing robbed for twenty dollars. My father survived, but had to persevere through his injuries and stay\npositive. That perseverance paid off for my father because he was able to achieve the American Dream.\nHe was able to build a successful Oriental rug business, be a good citizen and raise a family.\nI grew up working in my father’s rug business greeting customers with a smile, cleaning the store and one\nof my fondest memories of my father having me hand out roses to all the women on Mother’s Day. I love\nthe memories of my father and how he respected everyone and his philosophy in life was life is what we\nmake of it. He would always seek out the person in the room that was sad or upset and feel it was his job\nto make them smile and laugh. He would always say I could let them ruin my day or I can add love and\nlaughter to theirs. My father loved to laugh.\nI am running for the U.S. Congress because our country finds itself in a perilous fight and the American\nDream is being put out of reach for many Americans. Yes. The people are being stressed out by our\ncurrent President, the Republican Leadership and the direction they are taking our country. They just\npassed so called tax reform legislation that in the end will cost taxpayers money, most likely end up\nraising taxes on hard working families and raise the debt another 1.5 trillion dollars. They are also\nsponsoring legislation that will take health care insurance away from children. I believe this is putting\nAmerica on the wrong track.\nI believe the American people want their representatives to focus on creating a strong economy. One\nthat creates new family wage paying jobs, and creates jobs and opportunities for our children and\ngrandchildren.\nWorking families must be the priority, working families are the backbone of America. I will strongly support\nLabor Unions, collective bargaining, Davis-Bacon, project labor agreements and fair trade.\nWe must create new Labor Union supported manufacturing plants here in America using high tech to out\ncompete China, India, Japan, Vietnam and other countries. The model of sending money and jobs out of\nAmerica for profit is not a model we can follow any more. We must fight to bring jobs and manufacturing\nback into America. We must focus on creating jobs in America now by being competitive and using new\ntechnology to compete and at the same time pay our workers a family-supporting wage. We should find\ncompanies who want to invest in America and make America’s economy stronger. That is a model we\nshould strive for.\nI will create a Jobs Leadership Team in Texas’ 2nd District by bringing together Democrats, Republicans,\nLabor Leaders, Business Leaders, Public Officials, Community Leaders, Senior Citizens, Veterans,\nStudents, and individuals interested in discussing ways to create more jobs in Texas.\nNationally, we must balance the budget. We must bring down the national debt. We must create and\nmaintain a modern defense force that protects America. But we must always seek to establish real peace\nthrough negotiations, before we ever send our men and women in uniform into war.\nI’ll fight to keep America safe, work hard for the working families of Texas to create family wage paying\njobs, promote investment in new high tech manufacturing plants, work to strengthen Labor Unions,\nsupport public education, strongly support our veterans, work hard for senior citizens by protecting social\nsecurity and Medicare, strongly support a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions, help\nfamily farms, support the social safety net, support sportsmen and hunters, and protect our environment.\nI have been talking to voters in cafes and their homes. The people in Texas’ 2nd District are also\nconcerned about neighborhood safety. I’ll create a bi-partisan neighborhood safety committee to address\nthe peoples concern and find effective solutions that can make people feel safe again.\nI will dedicate myself everyday to making a positive difference in the lives of the working families, senior\ncitizens, veterans, and students in Texas so all individuals, regardless of race, color, gender, or age, will\nbe able to achieve the “American Dream.”\nI believe that running for the United States Congress is a natural extension of my career and community\nservice. I am also running for the U.S. Congress because I have a passion for specific issues that I will\nfight for in the U.S. Congress. I will work with all U.S. Congressmen, Republicans and Democrats, who\nwant to work together to bring Americans back together, not divide us. I will fight for Animal Rights and\nsupport legislation that will protect our dogs, cats and all animals. I will strongly support legislation to bring\nhealth care to all especially our children. Health Care should be a right not a privilege. Our veterans must\nbe taken care. The pain and suffering for those who have given their lives to protect our freedoms should\nat least have the opportunity to have proper care when they return from the battle field. I will work hard to\nprotect women and children. No women or child should be subjected to sexual abuse or harassment. Our\nchildren are our future. We must take care of them and protect them.\nIn addition our standing in the world must also be a priority. I look to President John F. Kennedy’s words\nas the kind of words I would like to hear from our current elected leaders. He said:\n“I believe in an America that is on the march - an America respected by all nations, friends and\nfoes alike - an America that is moving, doing, working, trying - a strong America in a world of\npeace. That peace must be based on law and order, on the mutual respect of all nations for the\nrights and powers of others and on a world economy in which no nation lacks the ability to\nprovide a decent standard of living for all of its people.”\nI understand that America's leadership in the world depends on our leadership here at home.\nI can stand up to my own party, if needed, and I will stand up to Donald Trump and the Republican\nLeadership when necessary. More importantly, I will stand up for the nation and for the people of Texas\nand do my best to work with both parties to address our most pressing problems and to keep America the\nwelcoming place of opportunity, diversity and equality we all expect it to be.\nWe must work together to make ensure that our decisions are the wishes of our citizens. We must all be\nheld accountable for our decisions and have transparency. It’s an honor and privilege to hold this position\nand it should retain its integrity. Sometimes the right decision is the unpopular one, but it’s the one that\nmust be made. I want everyone in the district to know we are here for them. I plan on being held\naccountable for my actions and with transparency on decisions and how I do my job. In the end we are all\nhuman beings and no matter how successful we may be will only progress by helping those less fortunate\nand giving opportunities to those who want them and are willing to work for them.\nI’m HP Parvizian from Houston, Texas, and that’s why I’m running for the United States Congress. I ask\nfor your vote on Tuesday, March 6th, 2018!",
    "transformTexas": "My top priorities will be Jobs, Health Care for Children and Equality for All.\nFirst I will fight for our Jobs and the Economy. By improving our infrastructure including\ntransportation we will increase jobs with living wages locally to allow our children and\ngrandchildren to stay close to home. We must request a study from the Corp of\nEngineers on our current infrastructure, including our dam and reservoirs. A proposed\nsolution taking into account our future growth to allow us to not only improve our district\nbut also our City. I will also protect our environment and our City Green Spaces.\nSecond I will fight for Health Care for Children. I will fight to ensure every child has the\nopportunity for health care and ensure CHIP has no funding delays.\nThird I will fight for Equality for All. I will fight for equality for all. While in D.C. I am\nprepared to fight for the rights of all our citizens. Here in Houston I will work on uniting\nand stopping the divide that is only hurting the people. We will work together and focus\non building this city as Texans as we did during Harvey.",

We made the greatest expansion in Texans veterans benefits since the Texas Veterans Land Board began in 1947 and we successfully managed the recovery from Hurricanes Ike and Dolly. After Hurricane Harvey, todays GLO did not even sign contracts to manage the two FEMA funded temporary emergency housing programs until almost 4 months after landfall. Regarding the Alamo, I was able to negotiate the gift of iconic rock star Phil Collins Alamo artifacts collection to the Alamo/State of Texas. In 2011, the legislature had transferred the management of the Alamo from the Daughters of the Republic of Texas (DRT) to the GLO. We then entered into a contract with the DRT to manage the Alamo under GLO direction. My successor terminated that contract in 2015, and was later engaged in litigation with the DRT over ownership of the Alamo Library archives. That was settled in favor of the DRT and the GLO was ordered to pay the DRT attorneys fees. That litigation would not have occurred had I been Commissioner.",

I felt a calling to ensure that others would have the same opportunity to succeed that I had.  So I ran for the Texas House.  This legislative session, I am proud to have written and passed legislation that cut unnecessary and burdensome regulations, protected our families and keep children out of foster care, and addressed an important Special Education problem.\n\nWhen Congressman Poe announced his retirement, I felt it my duty to take my legislative experience here in Texas to Congress.\n\nI believe our nation needs proven leaders more than ever.

My neighbors in House District 126 are very familiar with my voting record; I sent it to them every week in my Capitol Updates that were delivered to the inbox of anyone who asked. I believe that you are entitled to know exactly how your elected officials are representing your interests.

For example, for national security reasons and our nation’s economic security, we must get the coastal barrier built.  Three years ago I laid out a plan to fund and build the barrier system and, although my opponent is on the committee of jurisdiction, he and Congress have failed to get it done!

While a state representative for two terms, my opponent introduced 24 bills, many never even had a hearing and only four of them (18%) became law. I got almost twice as many bills enacted as my opponent, and I was not an elected official while he was! \n\n- On the federal level I played a key role in passing many pieces of important legislation, including the Export Administration Act that is now one of the laws being used to implement sanctions on North Korea.  My opponent has introduced about 30 bills, over 90% of which have not had hearings and have died in committee.  Some of the bills he has introduced were companion bills which were actually drafted by Senator Cornyn and merely introduced by my opponent on the Senator’s behalf.\n\n- As Chief Deputy Clerk for Elections in Galveston County I got everything done that I set out to do when initially hired, including bringing countywide Election Day voting to Galveston County.  I was able to bring together people of divergent political backgrounds to form a team of election workers who worked well with each other and the voting public.  And this ability also translated into accomplishments in Austin where I was able to forge consensus on legislative initiatives.\n\nI am a doer, not a talker; a workhorse who is determined and dedicated to accomplish things for the 14th Congressional District.

    "previousServed": "Civil Service Commissioner in Oakland, Calif., 2009-2012.",
    "military": "No",
    "reason": "I am running for Congress to fight for the interests of working people. I am offended by the conduct of the current representative, Michael McCaul, who has voted to repeal health care for tens of millions of people; personally enrich himself at the expense of the rest of us by supporting the recent tax bill; and who is otherwise devoted to advancing the interests of the richest Americans. Central Texas deserves a representative who will fight for workers, students, immigrants, seniors, people of color, LGBT folks, and all of our neighbors and community members who are suffering under the Trump administration.\n\nMy background is in public education and civil rights law, and my service has prepared me for this campaign. I trained as a public school teacher in Houston, Texas in the summer of 1999, as a corps member in the Teach for America program. I taught third grade, fifth grade, and eighth grade in the public schools. I joined the teachers' union and joined struggles against school closures and the privatization of public education. I co-founded two nonprofit education agencies, including Oakland Leaf, which for fifteen years has provided hundreds of students with free after-school and summer programs emphasizing academic achievement and creative expression.\n\nAs a lawyer, I started out in a small civil rights practice, representing employees who had suffered discrimination and whistleblowers who suffered retaliation. I took on unpopular causes, offering pro bono support to protestors arrested in the \"Occupy\" movement and representing Latino youth wrongly accused of being gang members. More recently, I was hired as an Assistant City Attorney at the City of Austin. At the City, I have served as a lead attorney in the struggle against Senate Bill No. 4, helping to coordinate a coalition of lawyers from major Texas cities and winning a critical injunction in federal court in August 2017. I have also sued landlords of derelict housing complexes, and I represent the City in several other cases against the State of Texas, fighting for the ability of Austin voters to maintain local control over our government. \n\nI was inspired to run by the recent gains made by Democrats in Virginia and Oklahoma, and by the opportunity to run a serious campaign in the 10th Congressional District. Since the Republicans gerrymandered Texas in 2002-2003, the incumbent has dominated every general election. In the last few election cycles the Democratic Party has fielded a relatively nominal candidate, who has mounted little to no ground campaign. I was raised in a community organizing household and intend to bring a determined grassroots approach to this campaign.\n\nI see the 10th District as an opportunity for the people to start taking back Texas. Before gerrymandering, the 10th was the District of Lloyd Doggett, and before that the District of Lyndon B. Johnson. I am running a campaign that will knit together some of the diverse constituencies that, when united, will give working people a chance to have a real representative in Congress.",
    "transformTexas": "This campaign is transformative in both its process and its objectives. Due to gerrymandering and the polarization of electoral politics, the 10th District has been deemed a \"safe\" district for Michael McCaul and the Republican Party. Yet, this District is not safe for Texans who rely upon the Affordable Care Act. It is not safe for U.S.-born young people who live in \"mixed status\" families and fear that their parents may be taken from them. The 10th District is not safe for women who need reproductive health care. It is not safe for any of us who rely upon governmental programs -- because the recent tax bill will be used to justify  austerity programs and further attacks on Medicare and Social Security. If this District is not safe for us, why should it be safe for Michael McCaul?\n\nIn order to surmount the gerrymandered map and the tremendous wealth of the incumbent (who is said to be worth $300m), this campaign relies upon people power. As a statement of intent, I did not pay the $3250 filing fee, but instead recruited 42 volunteers to circulate petitions to get my name on the ballot. Now, we are building on that volunteer base. I have received support from the Austin Central Labor Council; AFSCME Local 1624, the City of Austin and Travis County workers union; and UNITE HERE, Local 23, representing airport workers; and I am up for the Texas AFL-CIO endorsement this coming weekend. By putting together a campaign of union workers, members of the \"Indivisible\" movement, supporters of the immigrant rights movement, and others who are fed up with business as usual, I intend to mobilize hundreds of Texans between now and the general election. \n\nThrough this mobilization, we will test whether Texas is truly \"Trump Country.\" Michael McCaul votes with the President 98.4% of the time - more than any other Congressperson in Texas. Yet, I suspect that many Texans have no desire to kiss the ring of a Manhattan billionaire who is too scared to show us his tax returns. And we will only find this out by meeting each voter at his or her doorstep.\n\nIf I am elected through this people's campaign, I will be a people's representative. The current \"representative\" refuses to meet with his constituents. When Austin and Houston constituents come to his office, he is not there, and often his staff will not even open the door. When we write him letters expressing our concerns, we receive back an unresponsive form letter. This is not representation. \n\nAs a Representative of the 10th Congressional District, I will fight for the needs of the greatest number of my constituents. My priority will be to ensure that the federal government of the wealthiest country on earth ensures that all of us have the basic necessities of life, from health care and housing to quality public education, clean air, and clean water. The incumbent continues to demonstrate completely skewed priorities -- his recent demand for $18 billion for the border wall as compensation for continuing the DACA program is one of his most cynical ploys. Of course, the border wall will do nothing to make Central Texas and the Gulf Coast safer. We need that money to rebuild our flood infrastructure -- Hurricane Harvey showed us how vulnerable the Barker and Addicks dams are, among other facilities -- and we also need that money for bridges and roads, and for  programs that will put our District to work. \n\nThe transformation I will bring will be to put the people of the 10th District first.",

    "differences": "I have a demonstrated record of fighting for the most vulnerable among us. Through my work in public education and civil rights law, I have worked for students and teachers, immigrants and families, victims of discrimination and harassment, workers and unions. My record of public service makes me a credible alternative to the incumbent, who instead has a record of self-service.\n\nUnlike my opponents, and unlike any recent Democratic candidate in the 10th District, my campaign is building a field operation that will reach voters from Lake Travis to Tomball; from the University of Texas to Prairie View A&M; from Austin to Houston. By way of example, this past weekend began with several of us driving from Austin to La Grange to knock on doors for Beto O'Rourke and myself with the Fayette County Democratic Party; continued with a Cypress Indivisible forum that resulted in several Harris County activists joining my volunteer team; and ended with block-walking in Central Austin and a house party attended by two dozen new donors and supporters.  It is essential to build a comprehensive campaign of this nature to present a real challenge to the incumbent.\n\nUltimately, I respect the policy perspectives of my opponents, and believe that each of us bring energy and ideas that is sorely needed in this District. My campaign will bring a determined effort, backed by my experience of fighting for justice and equality, and powered by the numerous District 10 voters who are ready to roll up their sleeves and spread the message that \"Texas is not Trump Country.",

The failure to properly plan and invest in infrastructure has caused Texans to be harmed by natural disasters, such as Hurricane Harvey. I believe in real solutions, not rhetoric, to solve these and other problems we face. As Board President in Fort Bend ISD, I led our Board to cut property taxes for our community while giving teachers a pay raise, something the state government has not been able to do. We have invested in and improved struggling schools for all our students. As a mother of a child with a disability and a long-time advocate for families, I led Fort bend ISD to begin improving special education before it became a headline in the newspapers. I will take this experience and record of proven results to the Texas Senate and be a leader in offering solutions for all Texans.",

I’ll work to improve our education system so that every child can attend a great public school, regardless of their zip code. I’ll also do everything I can to ensure investment in our infrastructure so that businesses have what they need to come to Houston and grow, residents can move around our region safely and without being stuck in endless traffic, and our homes and neighborhoods are protected from flooding.

Along the way, I’ve learned how to do what so many politicians cannot: listen to people across diverse communities, appreciate their strengths, and work alongside community members to generate ideas and solve problems. It’s this approach and leadership–making Houstonians the priority–that we need more of in Washington.\n\nOur campaign also stands out as having the broadest base of support. Endorsements received during this campaign include the late Texas Governor Mark White, State Representative Armando Walle, City Council Member Mike Laster, HISD Trustees Anna Eastman and Anne Sung, Michael Skelly and Whitlock, UNITE HERE Local 23, Harris County Tejano Democrats, and more than 60 other community leaders. In addition, as the highest-fundraising U.S. House challenger campaign in Texas, we have demonstrated our ability to raise the resources needed to compete in the general election. Lastly, we are building a campaign that seeks to include people who have been left out of the process in the past, knocking on doors across the district and speaking with voters who have never previously had an in-person conversation with a campaign staffer or volunteer–much less a candidate.",

Sad but true enough, our current representative has been in this seat through the last three Presidents. He has not been vocal, and yet has quietly and consistently voted against the people. He has supported cuts to Medicare, despite the millions of seniors depending on Medicare. He has voted against equal pay for women despite knowing that 85% of women over the age of 65 are in poverty. The list goes on in proof that our current representative votes against the citizens, including not addressing the isssue of climate change. Our representative will not even meet with the citizens at Town Hall meetings. This is horrifying. You and I deserve a representative that is not detached, but has actually touched the issues impacting citizens head on. As a Registered Nurse and Public Administrator, I have seen first hand the domino effect of cutting necessary programs such as healthcare for adults and children. Supporting cuts to Medicare and Medicaid drastically hurts seniors in nursing homes, disabled children and adults, as well as children throughout Texas schools. Jobs are lost along with homes, and families are dismantled. We deserve representation that sincerely will fight for us. I am the person to advocate and fight for the citizens.",

This was not right and did not sit well with me. Despite Texas having the highest number of uninsured citizens, and thousands of people leaving this earth too soon because they were diagnosed late due to no health insurance, and 85% of women over the age of sixty five being in poverty, my representative still voted against the people. From that point on, I have worked tirelessly to give the citizens of CD10 true representation.

I grew up in poverty with a single mother who passed away early.  When I lost my mother, in many ways, I inherited her role as caretaker.  I was expelled from high school due to missing too many days and it took some time to get back on track to getting my GED and eventually graduating from law school.

After serving less than a year on the board of an organization that serves homeless youth, I was entrusted to be the president after its founding board member and first president resigned.

    "transformTexas": "My top priorities are healthcare and education, which together make up 70% of the state’s budget.\nEDUCATION: Texas schools are 43rd in the nation. This is unacceptable. We need new leadership to reform the education system. We can start by attracting and retaining the best teachers with a $5,000 pay increase, funded by closing a $5 billion property tax loophole that primarily benefits out of state commercial property owners. I’ll build strong pre-K programs and vocational training for high school students. I’ll reform our broken school finance system that is unfairly burdening homeowners. And, I’ll never allow public tax dollars to fund private school voucher programs. Our state Constitution requires us to educate every child, and when I am governor, we will do right by our kids.\n \nHEALTHCARE: Texas has the highest rate of uninsured Americans in the country.  And yet, Gov Abbott refuses to cash a check for $6 billion per year from the federal government to expand Medicaid. It’s our money - we should be able to use it for our healthcare. I’ll cash that check and expand Medicaid, so we can stop treating the uninsured in expensive emergency rooms. I’ll also increase funding for mental health, which will reduce the pressure on hospitals and jails. Finally, rather than restricting options for women’s health, I’ll expand them.\n\nPROPERTY TAXES: Gov Abbott is failing in his two most important state budget items - education and healthcare - and this failure is driving counties to increase your property tax bill.  When we fix these two issues, it will take the pressure off your property tax bill.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE: As our cities grow, so do our infrastructure needs. I’ll invest in smart plans to rebuild our aging highways and reduce traffic. I support the proposed, 100% privately financed bullet train.\n \nVOTING: Gov Abbott has made voting difficult under the pretense that Texas has a voter fraud issue. There is no data to support this claim. In fact, courts have decided the real reason behind so many of these laws is to discriminate against minority voters.  Our state should allow automatic voter registration whenever a citizen interacts with a government entity. And, I’ll work to make our state’s 2020 redistricting map fair and consistent with a citizen-led redistricting process.",

With that spirit, I’m running to be the next governor of Texas.\n\nI’ve started businesses for the last twenty years. I know how to create jobs, tackle complex problems and build consensus around even the most difficult issues.  I’ll bring my proven track record as a community leader and business owner to the Governor’s office and work to bring sanity and reason back to Texas government.

    "reason": "I am running for office because our community is not being properly represented.  Upon election, our Representative joined a fringe faction that is focused on undermining local control and setting their special interest agenda from Austin.  Instead of crafting solutions for the serious issues facing the state and our community, my opponent chose to focus on bathrooms and eliminating funding for counties, cities, hospital districts, and other local governments.   Frankly, the citizens of House District 150 deserve better.  \n\nOur rapidly growing community in the unincorporated area of Harris County has many needs, including flood control and prevention, property tax relief, better support for our local schools, and additional investment in public safety and transportation infrastructure.  If elected, my goal will be to focus on those items and continue to improve our community.",
    "transformTexas": "My primary focus is on representing the families and individuals who live and work in House District 150.  If elected, I will do my best to faithfully serve every person, regardless of their party affiliation or political beliefs.  I will collaborate with others and work diligently to find solutions to make our community a better place to grow up, raise a family, and build a business.  I don't know if improving the lives of those in our community will transform the entire state, but I hope that it transforms our small part of Texas in a very positive way.",

    "differences": "My opponent has made the unfortunate choice of aligning herself with a very small group in Austin that is neither conservative nor Republican.  It is a faction, funded by a special interest PAC, that seeks to consolidate power in Austin. Using scare tactics, bullying, and intimidation, this group would prefer to abandon the principles of smaller government, fiscal constraint, and family values.  Unfortunately, this choice has alienated her from the majority of her fellow members in the Legislature.\n\nMy opponent has known for years about the flooding issues along Cypress and Willow creeks.  However, she did not author a single bill to help with flood control in our area.  Instead she focused on arcane issues like reimbursing expenses of raising children for foster parents, which could have directly benefited herself. \n\nMy opponent has no interest in real property tax reform.  She would rather see skyrocketing local taxes and the complete destruction of the public school system and while the state of Texas continues to contribute less and less. \n\nMy opponent is not qualified for the position she holds.  She lacks the knowledge, skills, allies, and experience to be successful in the Texas Legislature.  After Hurricane Harvey, our community simply can not afford to wait for effective representation.",

    "reason": "I've had enough. I'm tired of career politicians. I'm tired of the blame and divisiveness. I'm tired of the do-nothing Congress. I've always been passionate about my country and the government and its role in our lives. Unfortunately, our government continues on this downward spiral of ineffectiveness. Whatever happened to \"the buck stops here\"? The polarization of the parties, the animosity towards those across the aisle and the total gridlock in Congress needs to stop. I think the only way we can do that is to bring in new leaders with energy and a fresh perspective. We need to have representation with a more diverse background; enough lawyers and career politicians. We need to bring in people with experience in the private sector, most notably more teachers, doctors, scientists and engineers. We need problem solvers in Washington. In its most simplistic definition, engineers solve problems. That is my background and that is what I've been doing for the past 10 years, which is why I think I'm a good choice for the district.",
    "transformTexas": "Integrity - I plan on restoring the integrity of the office of United States Representative by passing legislation that will bring accountability to the government, starting with a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget.\nSecurity - I will work with other Texas representatives to ensure our airports and the Port of Houston have the staff, resources and equipment necessary to deter and detain any illicit trafficking in people, drugs, illegal weapons and money. This will require further federal funding. Additionally, I will propose legislation to ensure that defense funds are being used effectively - eliminating wasteful and inefficient programs while increasing funding on advanced weapon systems and technology. We need to spend responsibly - prioritize our initiatives and cut defunct programs. \nLiberty - I will ensure legislation is passed so we that all citizens regain their freedoms - to free speech, to own a firearm, to choose their own education, to choose their own healthcare but without constant over-regulation. We need to cut the size of government to a more effective and nimble size - the more laws and regulations we eliminate, the more free we become.",
    "firstPriority": "Balance the federal budget – we have a serious spending problem and current officials (Democrats and Republicans) are not doing anything about it. I believe the purse of the US Government should be managed in a fashion similar to a personal checking account. It is preposterous that our elected officials are not spending taxpayer money responsibly.",
    "secondPriority": "Term limits for Senators and Representatives (maximum 12 years) – no more career politicians! I will propose legislation that would put term limits on Senators (2 terms – 12 years) and Representatives (6 terms – 12 years) starting in 2020. Any official first elected prior to 2020 would not be impacted (they would be “grandfathered”). This would be extremely popular across the country and I believe this would get overwhelmingly bipartisan support, while not impacting current officials.",
    "thirdPriority": "National security (and maximizing the effectiveness of Defense spending) – we are not spending money effectively. We need to fund a strategic border wall (not sea-to-sea), increase CBP, DHS and TSA agents across the borders and we need to increase federal funding for port cities (like Houston that has the second busiest port in the nation). We aren’t doing enough to ensure there are no missed cargo vessels, containers, shipments and we aren’t spending enough resources and energy on stopping trafficking activities (people, weapons, drugs, money, etc.).",
    "differences": "I am a problem-solver- by education, by experience and by nature. I am an Engineer who has worked in the oil/gas industry managing projects, leading teams and solving problems for the past decade. I have the energy and passion to get things done and will work both sides of the aisle for common-sense solutions. I have no ties to the dysfunction in DC, I have no lobbyist backing, nor do I have coffers filled from special interest groups. I don't believe in career politicians and I hope I can pass legislation to put term limits on Representatives and Senators",
